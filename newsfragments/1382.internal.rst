Fix flaky interactive web3 console test

Due to the way components cross connect to each
other, not all logs of that startup routine are
happening deterministically. We were waiting on
a log that would sometimes never show up for all
valid reason. This test is now based on a log that
is guaranteed to show up unless a serious bug
happened.
