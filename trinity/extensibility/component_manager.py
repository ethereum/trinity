    The component manager is responsible for managing the life cycle of any available

    A :class:`~trinity.extensibility.component_manager.ComponentManager` is tight to a specific
    :class:`~trinity.extensibility.component_manager.BaseManagerProcessScope` which defines which
    components are controlled by this specific manager instance.

    This is due to the fact that Trinity currently allows components to either run in a shared
    process, also known as the "networking" process, as well as in their own isolated
    processes.

    Trinity uses two different :class:`~trinity.extensibility.component_manager.ComponentManager`
    instances to govern these different categories of components.

      .. note::

        This API is very much in flux and is expected to change heavily.
