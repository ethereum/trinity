        Applies the state transition function to ``state`` based on data in
        ``block`` or ``future_slot``. The ``block.slot`` or the ``future_slot``
        are used as a "target slot" to determine how the ``state`` should be
        advanced in the state transition.

        Invariant: ``state.slot`` is less than or equal to the "target slot".

        Callers are expected to provide exactly *one* of either ``block`` or ``future_slot``.
        ``block`` takes precedence over ``future_slot``. Perform a subsequent call to this
        method without the block if you need both functionalities.
